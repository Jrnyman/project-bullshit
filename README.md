Project Bullshit is a fighting game that incorporates roguelite elements like procedural generation. Fighters must unlock their true potential through VHS tapes gained by traversing through the map, beating enemies, clearing events or purchasing them from the shopkeeper. These VHS tapes will provide the player with attack moves and special techniques, bringing about many different fighting styles to defeat enemies and bosses along the way.
